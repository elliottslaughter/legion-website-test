      <p>After developing a functional Legion application, it is usually
necessary to profile and tune for performance. This page covers
techniques to achieving high performance in Legion applications.</p>

      <li><a href="#legion-runtime-performance-flags">Legion Runtime Performance Flags</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="preliminary-steps">Preliminary Steps</h2>

<p>When performance is desired, <em>always</em> build Legion in release mode
(i.e. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DEBUG=0 make</code>). Release mode ensures that expensive assertions
and checks are disabled, and that appropriate optimization flags are
used in the build. Also, remember to remove any unnecessary build
flags (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-DPRIVILEGE_CHECKS</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-DBOUNDS_CHECKS</code>, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-DLEGION_SPY</code>).</p>

<p>Set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OUTPUT_LEVEL</code> at an appropriate level. The default (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LEVEL_DEBUG</code>)
is usually acceptable as dynamic checks are sufficient to ensure that the
extra logging statements are not a performance problem. However, a higher
level such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LEVEL_SPEW</code> might cause problems, even when disabled on the
command-line.</p>

<p>If using GASNet, ensure that <a href="/legion-website-test/gasnet/">GASNet has been properly configured and
optimized</a>. GASNet can be important for performance on
multi-node runs.</p>

<h2 id="legion-prof">Legion Prof</h2>

<p>Before taking steps towards optimizing a program, it is usually
helpful to profile the application in question. Legion has a
task-level profiler called Legion Prof which is used for this purpose.</p>

<p>Legion Prof is compiled into all builds by default, so no additional
compile-time flags are required. However, it is always recommended to
compile Legion in release mode (i.e. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DEBUG=0</code>) before measuring
performance.</p>

<p>Legion Prof outputs its logs in a compressed binary format using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ZLIB</code>.
If you donâ€™t have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ZLIB</code> on your system, you can set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">USE_ZLIB=0</code> in
your Makefile.</p>

<h3 id="generating-a-profile">Generating a Profile</h3>

<p>To profile an application, run with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-lg:prof &lt;N&gt;</code> where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code> is the
number of nodes to be profiled. (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code> can be less than the total number
of nodesâ€”this profiles a subset of the nodes.) Use the 
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-lg:prof_logfile &lt;logfile&gt;</code> flag to save the output from each node to
a separate file. The argument to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-lg:prof_logfile</code> flag follows
the same format as for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-logfile</code>, except that a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%</code> (to be replaced
by the node number) is mandatory. Finally, pass
the resulting log files to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">legion_prof.py</code>.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nv">DEBUG</span><span class="o">=</span>0 make
./app <span class="nt">-lg</span>:prof &lt;N&gt; <span class="nt">-lg</span>:prof_logfile prof_%.gz
<span class="nv">$LG_RT_DIR</span>/../tools/legion_prof.py prof_<span class="k">*</span>.gz</code></pre></figure>

<p>(Note: there is now a Rust implementation of Legion Prof, which
supports a subset of the features, but is 5-15x faster than the Python
implementation above. See <a href="#rust-legion-prof">below</a> for details.)</p>

<p>This will generate a subdirectory called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">legion_prof</code> under the
current directory, including a file named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.html</code>. Open this file
in a browser. Note that, if you are attempting to view this file on
your local computer, modern browser security settings prevent Legion
Prof from working properly. Please see the instructions for <a href="#using-legion-prof-locally">Using
Legion Prof Locally</a>.</p>

<p>A sample of Legion Profâ€™s output is shown below.</p>

<p><img src="/legion-website-test/images/profiling/collapsed_profile.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This profile shows the utilization graph of the memories and processors
during the run. Legion Prof also can also display  more detailed
information as described in
<a href="#interacting-with-a-profile">Interacting with a Profile</a>.</p>

<h3 id="rust-legion-prof">Rust Legion Prof</h3>

<p>There is now a Rust implementation of Legion Prof, in addition to
Python. It supports a subset of the features of Python, but for the
features that are supported, the outputs are bitwise identical. See
below for usage instructions for the Rust profilers.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">curl <span class="nt">--proto</span> <span class="s1">'=https'</span> <span class="nt">--tlsv1</span>.2 <span class="nt">-sSf</span> https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
cargo <span class="nb">install</span> <span class="nt">--path</span> legion/tools/legion_prof_rs
legion_prof prof_<span class="k">*</span>.gz</code></pre></figure>

<p>The first line installs Rust. The second installs a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">legion_prof</code>
binary into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.cargo/bin</code>. The third runs the profiler. The supported
flags are substantially similar to the Python implementation and can
be queried with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--help</code>.</p>

<p>The following features are supported:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All utilization views (processors, channels, memories)</li>
  <li>Detailed views for:
    <ul>
      <li>Processors</li>
      <li>Channels</li>
      <li>Memories</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The following features are NOT currently supported:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Critical path analysis</li>
  <li>Task dependencies</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="interacting-with-a-profile">Interacting with a Profile</h3>

<p>The default view of the profile only shows overall utilization figures 
to display a broad overview of the performance of the application.
However, after clicking on the triangles on the left had side of the screen,
the profile can display more detailed information. This will uncollapse the
corresponding line to show the actual events that happened during the application.
For example, after clicking on the triangle for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">node 0 (CPU)</code>:</p>

<p><img src="/legion-website-test/images/profiling/uncollapsed_profile.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>Hovering over a box in this more detailed view will display relevant information
such as the name of the task, the start and end time, and the total duration
of the task. The color of the box will be lighter if the task was waiting or
ready to be scheduled, but was not actually executing.</p>

<p><img src="/legion-website-test/images/profiling/box_hover_profile.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>Some of the boxes in the profile are gray. These are groups of tasks that are 
too small to be viewed at the current zoom level. To zoom in, click and drag the 
mouse over a region of interest.</p>

<p><img src="/legion-website-test/images/profiling/zoom_profile.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>After zooming in on a section, you can return to the previous zoom level by
pressing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">u</code> on the keyboard. You can also reset the zoom level by pressing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code>.
For other options, use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">?</code> key to show a help message.</p>

<p><img src="/legion-website-test/images/profiling/help_profile.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Press <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">esc</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">?</code> to exit the help message.</p>

<p>One of the options in the help message was searching for tasks. To search for
a task, press <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">s</code>, type a search query, and press enter. Legion Prof will
highlight the matched tasks in red. To clear the search, press <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">c</code>.</p>

<p><img src="/legion-website-test/images/profiling/search_profile.gif" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="advanced-features">Advanced Features</h3>

<p>Legion Prof can interpret <a href="/debugging/#legion-spy">Legion Spy</a> data to draw
dependencies between tasks. This can be helpful when debugging performance issues.
To take advantage of this feature, run your application with both Legion Prof and
<a href="/debugging/#legion-spy">Legion Spy</a> logging enabled. Then pass both the Legion Prof
and <a href="/debugging/#legion-spy">Legion Spy</a> traces to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">legion_prof.py</code>.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nv">DEBUG</span><span class="o">=</span>0 make
./app <span class="nt">-lg</span>:prof &lt;N&gt; <span class="nt">-lg</span>:spy <span class="nt">-logfile</span> spy_%.log <span class="nt">-lg</span>:prof_logfile prof_%.gz
<span class="nv">$LG_RT_DIR</span>/../tools/legion_prof.py prof_<span class="k">*</span>.gz spy_<span class="k">*</span>.log</code></pre></figure>

<p>After Legion Prof creates the profile, you will be able to click on tasks that
have dependency data. Left-clicking will draw solid lines to tasks that depend
on the current task as well as from tasks that the current task depends on.
Hovering over a line will show which way the dependency flows.</p>

<p><img src="/legion-website-test/images/profiling/dependency_profile.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>Similarly, right-clicking will draw the parent/child relationships for the 
current task.</p>

<p><img src="/legion-website-test/images/profiling/parent_child_profile.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>You can deselect the current task by either clicking on a different task or
left/right clicking on the current task to remove dependency and parent/child
relationship lines, respectively.</p>

<p><img src="/legion-website-test/images/profiling/deselect_profile.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>Finally, pressing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a</code> will draw the critical path of dependencies in the
application. Inspecting this line can be helpful to determine where optimizations
should be made to improve the performance of the application. To remove the 
critical path line, simply press <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a</code> again.</p>

<p><img src="/legion-website-test/images/profiling/critical_path_profile.gif" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="using-legion-prof-locally">Using Legion Prof Locally</h3>

<p>If you try to access <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.html</code> locally (by opening 
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">file:///.../index.html</code>), you may run into issues and may not be able to view
the profile output. We recommend accessing your profile
over a remote web server. Alternately, you can spin up a simple web server
locally:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nb">cd </span>legion_prof
python <span class="nt">-m</span> SimpleHTTPServer
<span class="c"># or</span>
python3 <span class="nt">-m</span> http.server</code></pre></figure>

<p>and load your page on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">localhost:8000</code> from your browser.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you want to use Chrome on local profiles, launch Chrome with
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chrome --allow-file-access-from-files</code> from the terminal. Note that you will
need to completely close Chrome before doing this.</p>

<h2 id="general-optimization-techniques">General Optimization Techniques</h2>

<p>In general there are three primary factors that contribute
to the performance of a Legion application.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Overall task and data movement throughput</li>
  <li>Latency of the critical path through the task/copy graph</li>
  <li>Runtime overhead</li>
</ol>

<p>There are many variables which can impact each of these
three performance metrics including the decisions made by the
application mapper(s), the size and shape of the 
region trees, the selected regions and fields requested
by tasks, and the settings of many of the variables
specified on this page. The goal of performance profiling
is to determine which variables are impacting performance
and tune them for the best performance. Due to the large
parameter spaces in Legion programs this is a difficult
problem to solve in general. We therefore give some basic
suggestions that we use when tuning Legion applications.</p>

<p>When tuning our Legion applications we usually make heavy
use of Legion Prof to understand the costs of our mapping
decisions and the performance of the runtime. A normal tuning
cycle involves profiling the execution of our application,
investing Legion Prof output to determine the most pressing
bottlenecks, and then modifying the necessary parameters
or Mapper implementations. Legion Prof time lines are the
most common output that we investigate as they can show
which processors are under-utilized as well as when there
are bubbles in task execution. While this is useful, it
doesnâ€™t always suggest why there are bubbles. Legion Prof
does not show data movement operations and therefore bubbles
can be caused either by critical path dependencies, or by
pending data movement operations. We currently rely on
application specific information to discern the cause.</p>

<p>While the performance of the application is usually the
limiter, it is also possible for runtime overhead to be a 
performance limiter. This most commonly manifests by seeing
bubbles in processor executions. The real indicator
is evident when looking at the runtime meta-tasks being
run on the utility processors. If the runtime is not
running sufficiently far ahead of the actual execution of
the program, the IDs of the tasks being mapped will be
in close proximity to the tasks being executed. If the 
runtime is running efficiently it will often be 10s to 100s
of IDs in front of the actual execution.</p>

<p>Performance debugging, even in Legion, is still very much
an art form and we are open to suggestions as to ways to
improve it. We are open to suggestions about new tools
to build to help with Legion debugging and are willing
to place the appropriate logging calls in the Legion 
runtime, especially if users are interested in helping
to write the post-processing and visualization tools. If 
you have suggestions, please post them to the 
<a href="/legion-website-test/community/">mailing list</a>.</p>

<h2 id="legion-configuration">Legion Configuration</h2>

<p>Legion has a large number of flags that impact performance. These can
be divided into two categories:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Flags to configure the machine (number of CPUs, GPUs, memory sizes, etc.)</li>
  <li>Flags to configure internal runtime parameters (scheduling windows, etc.)</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="machine-configuration">Machine Configuration</h3>

<p>Legion provides a multitude of command line parameters which can be
used to specify the machine configuration that is made visible to an
application and its mapper through the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Machine</code> object. All these
flags are interpreted by the Realm low-level runtime and are therefore
prefixed with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-ll:</code>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-ll:cpu &lt;int&gt;</code> - Specify the number of latency optimized
 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Processors</code> to allocate on each node. Typically this
 should be one or two less than the number of physical CPU cores 
 available on a node. The default is 1.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-ll:util &lt;int&gt;</code> - Specify the number of utility <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Processors</code>
 to allocate on each node. Utility processors are used
 for performing runtime meta-tasks such as dependence analysis
 and mapping. More utility processors help reduce runtime
 overhead at the cost of consuming more hardware cores for 
 meta-work. The default is 1.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-ll:gpu &lt;int&gt;</code> - Specify the number of 
 GPUs on each node. This should be less than or equal to the number of discrete GPUs on
 the node. The default is 0.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-ll:amsg &lt;int&gt;</code> - Set the number of 
 threads used for handling active message traffic
 between nodes. There must always
 be at least one of these threads. Applications which are 
 very communication intensive may consider increasing the 
 number of threads for handling active messages. The default
 value is 1.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-ll:bgwork &lt;int&gt;</code> - Specify the number of 
 background threads. For applications
 which do significant movement of data between distinct 
 memories, increasing the number of background threads can significantly
 improve performance. There must always be at least one background
 thread. The default value is 1.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-ll:csize &lt;int&gt;</code> - Set the amount of system memory per node
 available to the CPUs (e.g. DRAM) in MBs. In general this value
 should be less than the maximum amount of physical memory available
 on a node. If it is set larger, applications may end up thrashing
 virtual DRAM pages. The default is 512 MB.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-ll:gsize &lt;int&gt;</code> - Specify the amount of memory
 that should be allocated to the GASNet global memory in MB. The GASNet
 memory provides a globally visible memory
 across all nodes. This means that all nodes can
 read and write the GASNet memory but at the extreme cost of 
 doing explicit RDMA reads and writes. The amount of GASNet
 memory divided by the total number of nodes must be less than
 or equal to the GASNet segment size (e.g. set by the
 environment variable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GASNET_PHYSMEM_MAX</code>). The default value 
 is 256 MB.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-ll:rsize &lt;int&gt;</code> - Set the amount of GASNet registered
 memory in MB to be allocated on each node. Registered memory
 is pinned memory that is registered with GASNet so that it
 may used for doing one-sided RDMA operations. It is therefore
 especially useful for placing physical instances which are
 often communicated in these memories (e.g. ghost region 
 instances). The maximum amount of registered memory must be
 less than GASNet segment size (controlled by the
 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GASNET_PHYSMEM_MAX</code> environment variable). The default value is 0.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-ll:fsize &lt;int&gt;</code> - Indicate the amount of memory
  in MB to be allocated for GPUâ€™s framebuffer memory. This value
  is required to be less than the total amount of physical GDDR5
  memory available in each GPU. The default is 256 MB.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-ll:zsize &lt;int&gt;</code> - Indicate the amount of zero-copy
  memory in MB to allocate on each node. Zero-copy memory is 
  memory that is mapped into each GPUs address space as well as
  to CPU-side DRAM and is therefore accessible by all the CPUs and
  GPUs on the same node. However, it is very slow for GPUs to
  access because reads and writes must traverse the PCI-E bus.
  For more information on zero-copy memory we refer users
  <a href="http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-best-practices-guide/#zero-copy">here</a>.
  The default value is 64 MB.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-ll:stacksize &lt;int&gt;</code> - Indicate the maximum stack size to allocate
  for each CPU thread in MB. By default the values is 2 MB
  (consistent with the Posix nominal value).</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-ll:sdpsize &lt;int&gt;</code> - Set the maximum amount of 
  pinned memory available for sending GASNet active messages on 
  a node. Users should really only need to increase this value 
  if they observe failures of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">set_payload</code> runtime method. 
  The default is 64 MB.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-ll:lmbsize &lt;int&gt;</code> - Indicate the maximum size 
  of active messages that can be sent between a pair of nodes 
  by fixing an upper bound on long message buffer (LMB) sizes 
  in MB. Larger messages will get broken into chunks of at most 
  this size. The default is 1 MB.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-ll:numlmbs &lt;int&gt;</code> - Set the maximum number
  of long message buffers that should be created between a
  pair of nodes. More buffers will increase the number of
  large active messages that can be in flight simultaneously,
  but at the cost of increasing pinned registered memory
  usage in the GASNet segment. The default is 2.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-ll:pin &lt;int&gt;</code> - Specify whether the 
  CPU system memory allocated by the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-ll:csize</code> flag should
  be pinned. Pinning the memory means that copies to and from
  the GPU can make use of the asynchronous DMA engines on the
  GPU. Note that pinning doesnâ€™t register this memory with
  GASNet which distinguishes this memory from registered memory.
  The default value is 1 indicating true.</li>

<h3 id="legion-runtime-performance-flags">Legion Runtime Performance Flags</h3>

<p>The Legion runtime itself also provides command-line flags for
controlling the execution of its out-of-order task processor. Not
surprisingly many of these flags are related to parameters which
are tuned by hardware architects in out-of-order processors. Since
Legion is built in software though, users have the direct ability
to tune these parameters to their particular application. In keeping
with the naming scheme used above, all Legion runtime flags
are prefixed by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-lg:</code>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-lg:window</code> - Specify the maximum number of operations that 
 can be outstanding in a given task context (e.g. how many
 sub-tasks and operations can a task issue) before the 
 task is stalled. This upper bound provides one way of 
 applying back pressure on long running tasks and prevent
 them from running too far in advance. In many ways this
 value is analogous to the size of a re-order buffer (ROB)
 in hardware processors.  The default value is 1024.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-lg:sched</code> - Set the maximum number of ready tasks which
 must be available to run on a low-level processor before
 the high-level runtime stops invoking the mapper to 
 schedule more tasks. This controls how far in advance
 tasks are scheduled onto a processor. Note by Littleâ€™s
 Law, more tasks must be mapped to a processor if the
 tasks require longer to map. In many ways this value is
 analogous to the number of entries available at reservation 
 stations for hardware resource units. The default value is 1.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-lg:width</code> - Indicate the number of operations which the
 high-level runtime should consider when making a scheduling
 pass. The wider this is, the more operations will be touched
 in a scheduling pass.  This can increase throughput, but also
 increase latency of scheduling on processors. This value
 is analogous to the super-scalar width of modern processors.
 The default value is 4.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-lg:message</code> - Specify the maximum size of messages in bytes that
 can be sent between two instances of the high-level runtime.
 Smaller message sizes can decrease the latency of communication
 by pipelining communication, but can achieve lower interconnect
 bandwidth. Larger messages can achieve higher bandwidth, but
 at the cost of higher latency. The default value is 4096 bytes
 to ensure reasonable latency and bandwidth by ensuring medium
 size GASNet active messages are used on both Infiniband and
 Cray GASNet conduits.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-lg:filter</code> - This flag is more subtle and we only encourage
 users to make use of it after gaining some understanding of
 how the Legion runtime operates. In some application, there are
 many live operations that are non-interfering in different
 ways simultaneously. Since most non-interference tests end
 up failing, there is significant amounts of runtime analysis
 that is not useful. To help reduce this overhead, users can
 request that the list of users of physical instances be
 trimmed to some maximum size, possible in a way that reduces
 the precision of runtime analysis but <b>not</b> in a way
 that is unsound. By default this setting is disabled with
 the value 0. Reasonable values are usually in the range of
 128 to 4096.</li>
